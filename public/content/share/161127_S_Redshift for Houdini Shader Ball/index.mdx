<p>I built a material test scene for use with Redshift in Houdini over the weekend. You can <a class="link link--loud-simple" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fm7akohi1mdqd7y/Redshift%20for%20Houdini%20Material%20Test%20Scene%20%28hhx%29.zip?dl=0">download</a> the project file.</p>

<p>Shader ball model is Sub-D and has non-overlapping UVs (I tried to make them as straight as possible while minimizing distortion).</p>

<!-- 
A while back I saw a series of generative artwork created using the gradient descent algorithm. Today at work I was given those images as references for a project, and I thought I could recreate the effect using particle flow with a data operator.

I made a rough version of the data op at work that does the job, but I thought it is a pretty neat effect so I decided to refine it a bit further and save it as a preset.

You can download the preset. Remember to use 16-bit or higher source images for better result!

Below is a short demo video: -->


This is a custom 3ds Max Particle Flow Data Operator that traces an image using gradient descent. 16-bit or higher sources recommended for best results. Download [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/890dw0abogf5c1h/hhx_Gradient_Tracer.zip?dl=1).

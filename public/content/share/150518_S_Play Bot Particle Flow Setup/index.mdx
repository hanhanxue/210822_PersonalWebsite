<p>I have been pretty busy at work lately and haven’t had much time to do any personal stuff, until now! Presenting Play Bot, a fun little Particle Flow RnD project.</p>

<p>The idea came when I saw this <a class="link link--loud-simple" href="https://vimeo.com/86046989">Thinking Particles RnD</a> from Santi Bono a few months back. I was curious to see how one could achieve a similar behavior using Particle Flow. The main behavior was quickly achieved after I looked at <a class="link link--loud-simple" href="http://www.andvfx.com/1511/ball-compensation/">this post</a> from Eloi Andaluz. After that it’s about adding to the basic script to have the tracking effect.</p>

<p>After the script was done, I decided to add a personal touch and designed and modeled the little robot.</p>

<p>As always you can <a class="link link--loud-simple" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/z52tx6izowcitci/Play%20Bot%20%28hhx%29.zip?dl=0">download</a> the scene if you want to play with it.</p>

When the topic of camera implementation in OpenGL is introduced, most of the resources I have come across opt for a first-person shooter (FPS) style system. This make sense for those who are interested in learning OpenGL for game applications, but from a UX standpoint it is a sub optimal scheme for scene navigation. The type of camera found in most 3D modeling software (Maya, Houdini, Cinema 4D, Blender, Rhino to name just a few) offers a more intuitive way to navigate around in 3D space. Since I'm more interested in applications for content creation, I have implemented this type of camera for use in my OpenGL projects.

## The Code
The object expects as inputs two floats (I recommend using delta x and y cursor coordinates) and enables tumbling, tracking and dollying. Object outputs view and projection matrices for use in your shader.

You can find the .h and .cpp files here. Below is the .h file to give an idea of available methods:
